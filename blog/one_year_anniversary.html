                        currently in the works. This modpack has been released publicly on my Ko-fi for some time now. I
                        would like to congratulate the first person to beat the modpack in it's beta state - Ostino from
                        the DejojoTheAwsome discord server! While the modpack has been heavily reworked since this
                        accomplishment, it is no small feat, nonetheless!</p>

                        This system was initially made with not much idea of what it would turn into, and much less that
                        it would be one of the largest compatibility-oriented features that the mod has to date. Thanks
                        to _ascens from the Create: Garnished discord server, many mods have gained support for hatchets
                        - AE2, Better Nether, Better End, Deeper & Darker, Create: Stuff & Additions - just to name a
                        few.</p>

                        views. These videos have helped with the development of Create: Garnished a lot, believe it or
                        not. The comments provide feedback and that feedback is taken into consideration for the next
                        major update. Or sometimes when bugs are accidentally released, they are showcased in the video
                        and I am able to solve the issue prior to releasing the next update.</p>

                    <p class="segment">In Create: Garnished v0.2, Garnishment Templates were added. While these were
                        later removed in the very next update - v0.2.1 - they did make for quite an interesting concept.
                        Essentially, they were used to artificially create other kinds of nuts from wheat dough... Yeah,
                        no wonder why this was removed almost immediately.</p>

                    <p class="segment">Create: Garnished v0.6 was possibly the one update that shaped the Create:
                        Garnished of today - the introduction of Nut Trees. This change singlehandedly altered the
                        design and functionality of tree farms, requiring you to filter out a given amount of nuts for
                        storage and to feed back into the system once you've cracked them. Without this, the core
                        principles and functionality that is commmonly recognized in Create: Garnished wouldn't exist
                        and the mod itself would most likely be very different.</p>

                    <p class="segment">Create: Garnished v1.0 introduced Hatchets, but without any functionality. Then
                        v1.1 came along, and changed how foods are looked at with Create: Garnished. Without the
                        Ravaging and Salvaging enchantments, there's a good chance that many of the foods currently in
                        the mod wouldn't exist or even be thought about. In fact, it's pretty likely that the mod would
                        have an entirely vegetarian diet without this feature.</p>

                    <p class="segment">Create: Garnished v1.3 not only introduced some festive delicacies, but also a
                        plethora of building blocks - 3 stone types, new wood options, and some sugary decorations! This
                        was also the first update that added a new stone type to the mod. This would also expand the
                        content added in future updates, being able to easily introduce more new stone types such as
                        Ritualistic Stone or Wyvern Stone.</p>

                        Milestones</h4>
                    <p class="segment">Create: Garnished v1.7 added the ability to redye large amounts of items, which
                        opened customization options up for the playerbase. This also allowed for mastic resin items to
                        be redyed, which removed some of the restriction on these items that were present in previous
                        versions.</p>

                        but I think it's time to discuss the future of the mod.</p>

                    <p class="segment">One subject that I've been thinking about for an update is nuclear atomic bom-
                        Toxic foods, potentially inspired by the Toxic Caves from Alex's Caves.</p>
                    <p class="segment">Most of the foods added in this update would have pros and cons (I don't think
                        that I need to explain how consuming radioactive apples is probably bad for your health).
                        However, with the downsides, they would provide the player with beneficial effects. Whether this
                        be high nutrition/saturation or beneficial status effects that aids the player, I'm interested
                        in seeing community feedback for these concepts.</p>
